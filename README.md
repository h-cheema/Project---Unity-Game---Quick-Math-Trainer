### Summary:


<br>

### Code Samples:

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelLocker.cs" target="_blank">LevelLocker.cs</a>_
	* Uses the player's current level to decide which levels are available to play. It instantiates level buttons and locks/disables specific ones which are not completed yet. It also uses a coroutine to make a button (current level button, next page button or previous page button) flash to help the player know what to do.

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelPreprocessor.cs" target="_blank">LevelPreprocessor.cs</a>_
	* Gathers the needed date to set up a level correctly. This includes things like the configuration of the shape columns, height gap between shapes, and the flow speed of the shapes.

* _<a href="https://github.com/h-cheema/SwitchyShapes-Overview/blob/master/LevelSpawner.cs" target="_blank">LevelSpawner.cs</a>_
	* Takes information from LevelPreprocessor.cs and spawns flowing shapes before the game starts.
